Chapter 1
- 16 digit numbers = Zombie's DNA.
- Every two digits map to a trait.
- Different formulas for each digit pair translation allows reduction in variation. i.e. 7 head types by doing "digits % 7 + 1"

Chapter 2
- All solidity code should start with a 'version pragma'. This identifies the version of the Solidity compiler which should be used for this code, preventing any future changes to the compiler from breaking this code.
- To start a new project, write:

pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;

contract HelloWorld {

}
